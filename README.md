Synopsis
==========
These are Ruby 1.9.2+ bindings to poly2tri.  It produces very nice triangulated
meshes out of pretty arbitrary polygons.

This release contains an a (slightly-modified) version of Revision 31c314fae1
of the poly2tri C++ branch.  Both poly2tri and rbpoly2tri are available under
BSD/MIT-style permissive licenses.  See poly2tri/LICENSE and LICENSE for
details.

*Note:* As of now, poly2tri assumes you're pretty hardcore and does assert-style
error checking.  If you feed rbpoly2tri a polygon with coincident/collinear 
points *it will crash*, because asserts have been disabled.  I'm working with 
poly2tri to see if this can be changed upstream, but if not, expect this issue 
resolved in the bindings copy soon.

To install:

    ruby ./extconf.rb
    make
    make install

Simple Usage:
===========
    require 'poly2tri'

    # The initial input must be simple (non-intersecting, no holes), and
    # repeated vertices are not allowed.  Holes may be added later.

    inp = [[100.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 47.85714326530613],
           [-4.999999, 50.0], [0.0, 50.0], [0.0, 100.0], [100.0, 100.0],
           [100.0, 50.0], [200.0, 50.0], [100.0, 5.0]]

    # CDT.  You know, Constrained Delaunay Triangulation.
    tess = Poly2Tri::CDT.new(inp)

    # if you're in the mood to add a hole to this polygon, now's the time:
    tess.add_hole [[10, 10], [10,30], [30, 30], [30,10]]

    tess.triangulate!
    triangles = tess.triangles # => A huge amount of vertices, man.
